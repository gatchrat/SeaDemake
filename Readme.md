# SeaDemake
A little game inspired by games like TransOcean, with the twist that everything is rendered down to its most basic elements. Buy ships, buy/sell wares and complete contracts, nothing else. Get the best deals, find the most effecient routes and grow a shipping empire. There is no tutorial, no buttons, just you, the console and the one Screen. How much money can you earn? Can you unlock all 14 harbours?
